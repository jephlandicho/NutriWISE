							The purpose of a sample meal plan is to promote a balanced diet that includes all the necessary macronutrients and micronutrients for optimal health. Macronutrients, such as carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, provide energy and support various bodily functions. Micronutrients, including vitamins and minerals, are essential for proper functioning of the body's systems and maintaining overall well-being.
